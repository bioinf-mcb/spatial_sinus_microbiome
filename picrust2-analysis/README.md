For this analysis, `PICRTUSt2` should be installed as described in the [manual](https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki/Installation).   
The required files for the prediction were obtained from the `QIIME2` artifacts with corresponding names.  The detailed information about obtaining them is located in `microbiome-analysis/sinus-qiime2-preprocessing`. As `.qza` files are archives, the data can be easily extracted using archivisation software.  
After predicition is done, the files are analyzed in the `QIIME2` environment.
